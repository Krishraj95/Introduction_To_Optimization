# Introduction_To_Optimization

In this project, me and my team members designed a student-friendly course planner that outputs an optimal schedule based on his/her preferences to graduate. The data used in this project is taken from the course list offered by CS department at UW-Madison (https://www.cs.wisc.edu/courses/list). We modelled the problem as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). Though the objectives to graduate are different for every person, we assume that every student's objective falls into one of the following categories :

1. Maximize grade point average
2. Graduate by choosing courses of minimum difficulty
3. Graduate by spending minimum tuition fees
4. Graduate with maximum knowledge in his/her's area of interest

We provide the optimal schedule based on the student's objective. The course planner was tested on data concerning only the courses offered by the Computer Science department at UW Madison. The objectives were framed keeping in mind the course requirements of the graduate students to complete their Master's program.
